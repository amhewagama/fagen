  <h1>Front Accounting App Generator</h1>

  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>The Front Accounting App Generator is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of generating user interfaces for Front Accounting modules. Front Accounting is a comprehensive accounting solution tailored for small and medium-sized companies. This generator simplifies the development process by automatically creating user interfaces based on MySQL tables.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>The Front Accounting App Generator is a separate Python tool designed to generate user interfaces externally. It operates independently from the Front Accounting system itself. Here's how the process works:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Generate Module:</strong> First, you use the generator to create a module with the required user interface components based on your MySQL tables.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy Module to Front Accounting:</strong> Once the module is generated, you copy it to your Front Accounting instance.</li>
  <li><strong>Access Setup:</strong> Set up access permissions for the newly created module within Front Accounting to ensure appropriate user access.</li>
  <li><strong>Add to App Menu:</strong> Next, you add the module to the application menu so users can access it seamlessly.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply Required Modifications:</strong> Finally, you may need to make any necessary modifications or customizations within the Front Accounting instance to ensure the module functions correctly within the broader system.</li>
</ol>

<p>By following these steps, you can efficiently generate and integrate user interfaces for your Front Accounting modules.</p>


<h2>Need to Develop</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dropdown Fields Identification:</strong> Currently, dropdown fields are not automatically identified from the database table. Development is needed to create functions that can identify dropdown fields and generate dropdown controls accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Generate Dropdown Functions:</strong> To support dropdown fields, specific functions need to be developed within the generator to generate dropdown controls based on the identified fields.</li>
  <li><strong>Replace Dropdown Functionality:</strong> Additionally, there's a need to implement functionality to replace dropdown controls with text controls if required. This ensures flexibility in handling different types of data inputs.</li>
</ul>
