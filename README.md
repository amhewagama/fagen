  <h1>Front Accounting App Generator</h1>

  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>The Front Accounting App Generator is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of generating user interfaces for Front Accounting modules. Front Accounting is a comprehensive accounting solution tailored for small and medium-sized companies.

    <li><strong>Analyze Table Structure:</strong> It examines the structure of each table, including column names, data types, and relationships.</li>
    <li><strong>Generate User Interface:</strong> Based on the table structure, the generator creates the corresponding user interface elements such as forms, tables, and menus.</li>
    <li><strong>Customization Options:</strong> Users have the option to customize the generated interfaces according to their specific requirements. This may include modifying layout, adding custom fields, or adjusting styling.</li>
    <li><strong>Export and Integration:</strong> Once satisfied with the generated interface, users can export the code and integrate it seamlessly into their Front Accounting instance.</li>
  </ol>
